#1)
#Make an example variable of each of the types of variables (int, float, 
#string, boolean and list):
#Integer
a = 5
print (a)
a = 4
print (a)
a= 3
print (a)
#Float

a = 3.45

a = 5.43

a= 4.32

#String

a = "Samantha"

a= "Michael"

a= "Nino"

a = "Samantha and Michael"

#Booleans

a = True

a = False

#List

a = [1, 2,3, 4]

a = ["Sam", "Michael", "Nino"]

a = [True, False, True]

a = [3.2, 4.5, 5.8]
print(a)
#2)
#Make two variables one named 'a' and one named 'A' both set to  different data:
#(Remember that capitalization matters, so these can be two different variables)

varA = 1
vara = 2

var = 4
var = "string"

varTwo = var
print(varTwo)

b = [a, varA, var]
print(b)

list = ["a", "b", "c"]
print(list[2])

listVar = list[0]
print(listVar)

string = "Samantha"
print(string[0])

print(5)
print("string")
print(True)
print(list)
